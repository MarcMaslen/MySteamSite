# MySteamSite.github.io
This is my recreation of steam that I made while I was at University. This is actually my first time making sure a big website and I ended up getting a First grade for it.

The website itself is very bland and doesnt contain much content, the game pages are all the same but of the different games. The biggest feature I added to the website was a Login
system using PHP. This was a great start for me and made me realise how much I enjoy web developement.
